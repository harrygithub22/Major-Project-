I've been using the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 with AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed by its raw power and features. Here's my detailed review:Pros:- Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences.- Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay.- Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips.- Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use.- Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.Cons:- Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check.- Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.Rating Breakdown:- Performance: 5/5- Display: 5/5- Battery Life: 4.5/5- Design: 4.5/5- Value: 5/5Would I recommend it?¬†Absolutely!Read more

I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition.Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.Read more

I am using the laptop for a month now, it's really fast, the graphics are good I was able to get average of around 80-85 fps on high graphics games with medium settings(Note: Medium settings also look great, it's just my personal preference cuz most high graphics games just make the road look like glass). I tried coding in this laptop and the performance was really phenomenal. The laptop is really good at this price of 60k, but they should improve the battery and the touchpadRead more

This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc...Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful.Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card.Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a "battery care mode" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it. Appearance is nice for gamers and having aura blacklit sync!!This review may be helpful for you about this laptop, it is worth as it has ryzen 7 7000 series as other laptops have most cost than this!!Top notch5/5 stars!!!Read more

I've been using the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 with AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed by its raw power and features. Here's my detailed review:Pros:- Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences.- Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay.- Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips.- Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use.- Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.Cons:- Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check.- Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.Rating Breakdown:- Performance: 5/5- Display: 5/5- Battery Life: 4.5/5- Design: 4.5/5- Value: 5/5Would I recommend it?¬†Absolutely!Read more

I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition.Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.Read more

I am using the laptop for a month now, it's really fast, the graphics are good I was able to get average of around 80-85 fps on high graphics games with medium settings(Note: Medium settings also look great, it's just my personal preference cuz most high graphics games just make the road look like glass). I tried coding in this laptop and the performance was really phenomenal. The laptop is really good at this price of 60k, but they should improve the battery and the touchpadRead more

This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc...Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful.Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card.Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a "battery care mode" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it. Appearance is nice for gamers and having aura blacklit sync!!This review may be helpful for you about this laptop, it is worth as it has ryzen 7 7000 series as other laptops have most cost than this!!Top notch5/5 stars!!!Read more

This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc...Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful.Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card.Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a "battery care mode" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it.

I've been using the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 with AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed by its raw power and features. Here's my detailed review:Pros:- Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences.- Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay.- Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips.- Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use.- Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.Cons:- Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check.- Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.Rating Breakdown:- Performance: 5/5- Display: 5/5- Battery Life: 4.5/5- Design: 4.5/5- Value: 5/5Would I recommend it?¬†Absolutely!Read more

I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition.Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.Read more

I am using the laptop for a month now, it's really fast, the graphics are good I was able to get average of around 80-85 fps on high graphics games with medium settings(Note: Medium settings also look great, it's just my personal preference cuz most high graphics games just make the road look like glass). I tried coding in this laptop and the performance was really phenomenal. The laptop is really good at this price of 60k, but they should improve the battery and the touchpadRead more

I am using the laptop for a month now, it's really fast, the graphics are good I was able to get average of around 80-85 fps on high graphics games with medium settings(Note: Medium settings also look great, it's just my personal preference cuz most high graphics games just make the road look like glass). I tried coding in this laptop and the performance was really phenomenal. The laptop is really good at this price of 60k, but they should improve the battery and the touchpadRead more

This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc...Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful.Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card.Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a "battery care mode" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it. Appearance is nice for gamers and having aura blacklit sync!!This review may be helpful for you about this laptop, it is worth as it has ryzen 7 7000 series as other laptops have most cost than this!!Top notch5/5 stars!!!Read more

I've been using the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 with AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed by its raw power and features. Here's my detailed review:Pros:- Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences.- Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay.- Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips.- Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use.- Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.Cons:- Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check.- Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.Rating Breakdown:- Performance: 5/5- Display: 5/5- Battery Life: 4.5/5- Design: 4.5/5- Value: 5/5Would I recommend it?¬†Absolutely!Read more

I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition.Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.Read more

Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.Read more

I am using the laptop for a month now, it's really fast, the graphics are good I was able to get average of around 80-85 fps on high graphics games with medium settings(Note: Medium settings also look great, it's just my personal preference cuz most high graphics games just make the road look like glass). I tried coding in this laptop and the performance was really phenomenal. The laptop is really good at this price of 60k, but they should improve the battery and the touchpadRead more

This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc...Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful.Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card.Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a "battery care mode" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it.

I've been using the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 with AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed by its raw power and features. Here's my detailed review:Pros:- Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences.- Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay.- Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips.- Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use.- Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.Cons:- Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check.- Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.Rating Breakdown:- Performance: 5/5- Display: 5/5- Battery Life: 4.5/5- Design: 4.5/5- Value: 5/5Would I recommend it?¬†Absolutely!Read more

I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition.Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery.

I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition.Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.Read more

I am using the laptop for a month now, it's really fast, the graphics are good I was able to get average of around 80-85 fps on high graphics games with medium settings(Note: Medium settings also look great, it's just my personal preference cuz most high graphics games just make the road look like glass). I tried coding in this laptop and the performance was really phenomenal. The laptop is really good at this price of 60k, but they should improve the battery and the touchpadRead more

This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc...Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful.Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card.Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a "battery care mode" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it.

I've been using the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 with AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed by its raw power and features. Here's my detailed review:Pros:- Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences.- Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay.- Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips.- Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use.- Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.Cons:- Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check.- Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.Rating Breakdown:- Performance: 5/5- Display: 5/5- Battery Life: 4.5/5- Design: 4.5/5- Value: 5/5Would I recommend it?¬†Absolutely!Read more

Here's my detailed review:Pros:- Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences.- Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay.- Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips.- Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use.- Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.Cons:- Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check.- Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.Rating Breakdown:- Performance: 5/5- Display: 5/5- Battery Life: 4.5/5- Design: 4.5/5- Value: 5/5Would I recommend it?¬†Absolutely!Read more

I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition.Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.Read more

I am using the laptop for a month now, it's really fast, the graphics are good I was able to get average of around 80-85 fps on high graphics games with medium settings(Note: Medium settings also look great, it's just my personal preference cuz most high graphics games just make the road look like glass). I tried coding in this laptop and the performance was really phenomenal. The laptop is really good at this price of 60k, but they should improve the battery and the touchpadRead more

This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc...Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful.Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card.Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a "battery care mode" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it. Appearance is nice for gamers and having aura blacklit sync!!This review may be helpful for you about this laptop, it is worth as it has ryzen 7 7000 series as other laptops have most cost than this!!Top notch5/5 stars!!!Read more

I've been using the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 with AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed by its raw power and features. Here's my detailed review:Pros:- Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences.- Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay.- Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips.- Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use.- Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.Cons:- Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check.- Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.Rating Breakdown:- Performance: 5/5- Display: 5/5- Battery Life: 4.5/5- Design: 4.5/5- Value: 5/5Would I recommend it?¬†Absolutely!Read more

I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition.Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.Read more

I am using the laptop for a month now, it's really fast, the graphics are good I was able to get average of around 80-85 fps on high graphics games with medium settings(Note: Medium settings also look great, it's just my personal preference cuz most high graphics games just make the road look like glass). I tried coding in this laptop and the performance was really phenomenal. The laptop is really good at this price of 60k, but they should improve the battery and the touchpadRead more

This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc...Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful.Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card.Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a "battery care mode" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it. Appearance is nice for gamers and having aura blacklit sync!!This review may be helpful for you about this laptop, it is worth as it has ryzen 7 7000 series as other laptops have most cost than this!!Top notch5/5 stars!!!Read more

This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc...Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful.Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card.Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a "battery care mode" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it.

I've been using the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 with AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed by its raw power and features. Here's my detailed review:Pros:- Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences.- Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay.- Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips.- Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use.- Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.Cons:- Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check.- Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.Rating Breakdown:- Performance: 5/5- Display: 5/5- Battery Life: 4.5/5- Design: 4.5/5- Value: 5/5Would I recommend it?¬†Absolutely!Read more

I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition.Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.Read more

I am using the laptop for a month now, it's really fast, the graphics are good I was able to get average of around 80-85 fps on high graphics games with medium settings(Note: Medium settings also look great, it's just my personal preference cuz most high graphics games just make the road look like glass). I tried coding in this laptop and the performance was really phenomenal. The laptop is really good at this price of 60k, but they should improve the battery and the touchpadRead more

I am using the laptop for a month now, it's really fast, the graphics are good I was able to get average of around 80-85 fps on high graphics games with medium settings(Note: Medium settings also look great, it's just my personal preference cuz most high graphics games just make the road look like glass). I tried coding in this laptop and the performance was really phenomenal. The laptop is really good at this price of 60k, but they should improve the battery and the touchpadRead more

This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc...Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful.Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card.Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a "battery care mode" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it. Appearance is nice for gamers and having aura blacklit sync!!This review may be helpful for you about this laptop, it is worth as it has ryzen 7 7000 series as other laptops have most cost than this!!Top notch5/5 stars!!!Read more

I've been using the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 with AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed by its raw power and features. Here's my detailed review:Pros:- Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences.- Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay.- Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips.- Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use.- Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.Cons:- Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check.- Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.Rating Breakdown:- Performance: 5/5- Display: 5/5- Battery Life: 4.5/5- Design: 4.5/5- Value: 5/5Would I recommend it?¬†Absolutely!Read more

I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition.Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.Read more

Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.Read more

I am using the laptop for a month now, it's really fast, the graphics are good I was able to get average of around 80-85 fps on high graphics games with medium settings(Note: Medium settings also look great, it's just my personal preference cuz most high graphics games just make the road look like glass). I tried coding in this laptop and the performance was really phenomenal. The laptop is really good at this price of 60k, but they should improve the battery and the touchpadRead more

This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc...Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful.Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card.Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a "battery care mode" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it.

I've been using the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 with AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed by its raw power and features. Here's my detailed review:Pros:- Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences.- Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay.- Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips.- Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use.- Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.Cons:- Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check.- Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.Rating Breakdown:- Performance: 5/5- Display: 5/5- Battery Life: 4.5/5- Design: 4.5/5- Value: 5/5Would I recommend it?¬†Absolutely!Read more

I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition.Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery.

I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition.Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.Read more

I am using the laptop for a month now, it's really fast, the graphics are good I was able to get average of around 80-85 fps on high graphics games with medium settings(Note: Medium settings also look great, it's just my personal preference cuz most high graphics games just make the road look like glass). I tried coding in this laptop and the performance was really phenomenal. The laptop is really good at this price of 60k, but they should improve the battery and the touchpadRead more

This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc...Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful.Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card.Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a "battery care mode" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it.

I've been using the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 with AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed by its raw power and features. Here's my detailed review:Pros:- Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences.- Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay.- Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips.- Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use.- Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.Cons:- Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check.- Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.Rating Breakdown:- Performance: 5/5- Display: 5/5- Battery Life: 4.5/5- Design: 4.5/5- Value: 5/5Would I recommend it?¬†Absolutely!Read more

Here's my detailed review:Pros:- Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences.- Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay.- Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips.- Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use.- Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.Cons:- Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check.- Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.Rating Breakdown:- Performance: 5/5- Display: 5/5- Battery Life: 4.5/5- Design: 4.5/5- Value: 5/5Would I recommend it?¬†Absolutely!Read more

I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition.Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.Read more

I am using the laptop for a month now, it's really fast, the graphics are good I was able to get average of around 80-85 fps on high graphics games with medium settings(Note: Medium settings also look great, it's just my personal preference cuz most high graphics games just make the road look like glass). I tried coding in this laptop and the performance was really phenomenal. The laptop is really good at this price of 60k, but they should improve the battery and the touchpadRead more

This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc...Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful.Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card.Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a "battery care mode" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it. Appearance is nice for gamers and having aura blacklit sync!!This review may be helpful for you about this laptop, it is worth as it has ryzen 7 7000 series as other laptops have most cost than this!!Top notch5/5 stars!!!Read more

I've been using the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 with AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed by its raw power and features. Here's my detailed review:Pros:- Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences.- Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay.- Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips.- Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use.- Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.Cons:- Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check.- Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.Rating Breakdown:- Performance: 5/5- Display: 5/5- Battery Life: 4.5/5- Design: 4.5/5- Value: 5/5Would I recommend it?¬†Absolutely!Read more

I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition.Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.Read more

I am using the laptop for a month now, it's really fast, the graphics are good I was able to get average of around 80-85 fps on high graphics games with medium settings(Note: Medium settings also look great, it's just my personal preference cuz most high graphics games just make the road look like glass). I tried coding in this laptop and the performance was really phenomenal. The laptop is really good at this price of 60k, but they should improve the battery and the touchpadRead more

This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc...Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful.Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card.Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a "battery care mode" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it. Appearance is nice for gamers and having aura blacklit sync!!This review may be helpful for you about this laptop, it is worth as it has ryzen 7 7000 series as other laptops have most cost than this!!Top notch5/5 stars!!!Read more

This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc...Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful.Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card.Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a "battery care mode" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it. Appearance is nice for gamers and having aura blacklit sync!!This review may be helpful for you about this laptop, it is worth as it has ryzen 7 7000 series as other laptops have most cost than this!!Top notch5/5 stars!!!Read more

Performance wise good but battery backup is very poor.  If battery backup will increase it will be one among  the best laptops.Read more

I've been using the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 with AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed by its raw power and features. Here's my detailed review:Pros:- Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences.- Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay.- Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips.- Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use.- Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.Cons:- Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check.- Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.Rating Breakdown:- Performance: 5/5- Display: 5/5- Battery Life: 4.5/5- Design: 4.5/5- Value: 5/5Would I recommend it?¬†Absolutely!Read more

I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition.Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.Read more

I am using the laptop for a month now, it's really fast, the graphics are good I was able to get average of around 80-85 fps on high graphics games with medium settings(Note: Medium settings also look great, it's just my personal preference cuz most high graphics games just make the road look like glass). I tried coding in this laptop and the performance was really phenomenal. The laptop is really good at this price of 60k, but they should improve the battery and the touchpadRead more
