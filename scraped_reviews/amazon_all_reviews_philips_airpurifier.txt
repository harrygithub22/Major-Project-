Bought the product and within 3 days it malfunctioned. AQI showed 500 when other air purifier (which we got from the 2nd bedroom as a reference check) showed it at 100. Called Amazon and were told to directly contact manufacturer or service center as they do not assist with return or replacement for this product. Moral: Do not buy high value electronics from Amazon. Deal directly with the distributor.Apparently there is a 10-day service center replacement but I am due to go on work travel tomorrow and by the time I return, it will be past the 10-day window. Not sure what will happen after that but at any rate, I would strongly advise against buying this product from Amazon. Perhaps it was bad luck to receive a defective piece but Amazon has added to our hassle rather than be of help.Read more

Review:
Great product. In just 20 minutes AQI dropped from 380 to 65. Good performance. Stylish and compact. Finally we are breathing some clean air.Read more

I've been using the Philips air purifier for a few weeks, and I'm very impressed. It effectively reduces dust and allergens, and the real-time air quality indicator is a great feature. It operates quietly, making it perfect for my bedroom. The sleek design also blends well with my decor. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to improve their indoor air quality!Read more

Review:
I have 3 of these in my home. And these are very effective throughout the year to keep the house clean and protect us from infections (lesser colds in the household and even if one person contracts it doesn't spread to others). We are sleeping more peacefully at night and allergic ailments have gone down.However, when Delhi becomes a gas chamber October last week and November first week (beyond 999 at unmeasurable levels), these purifiers struggle. They are able to bring down to within 100, which is good, but, not in the good range of <30. I have an infant who is struggling these days because of these elevated levels and the unfortunate fact that PM below 1.0 is also high in Delhi this winter. These purifiers operate till PM 2.5. I will have to try some other brands with more powerful purifiers given the rapidly deteriorating condition in our city.Read more

Review:
Works efficiently, just takes a bit more time to completely clear the particles in air, which is manageable in this price range. Can be easily adjusted anywhere in the room, compact cylindrical. Noise level is also very less.Read more

Bought the product and within 3 days it malfunctioned. AQI showed 500 when other air purifier (which we got from the 2nd bedroom as a reference check) showed it at 100. Called Amazon and were told to directly contact manufacturer or service center as they do not assist with return or replacement for this product. Moral: Do not buy high value electronics from Amazon. Deal directly with the distributor.Apparently there is a 10-day service center replacement but I am due to go on work travel tomorrow and by the time I return, it will be past the 10-day window. Not sure what will happen after that but at any rate, I would strongly advise against buying this product from Amazon. Perhaps it was bad luck to receive a defective piece but Amazon has added to our hassle rather than be of help.Read more

Review:
Great product. In just 20 minutes AQI dropped from 380 to 65. Good performance. Stylish and compact. Finally we are breathing some clean air.Read more

I've been using the Philips air purifier for a few weeks, and I'm very impressed. It effectively reduces dust and allergens, and the real-time air quality indicator is a great feature. It operates quietly, making it perfect for my bedroom. The sleek design also blends well with my decor. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to improve their indoor air quality!Read more

I have 3 of these in my home. And these are very effective throughout the year to keep the house clean and protect us from infections (lesser colds in the household and even if one person contracts it doesn't spread to others). We are sleeping more peacefully at night and allergic ailments have gone down.However, when Delhi becomes a gas chamber October last week and November first week (beyond 999 at unmeasurable levels), these purifiers struggle. They are able to bring down to within 100, which is good, but, not in the good range of <30. I have an infant who is struggling these days because of these elevated levels and the unfortunate fact that PM below 1.0 is also high in Delhi this winter. These purifiers operate till PM 2.5. I will have to try some other brands with more powerful purifiers given the rapidly deteriorating condition in our city.Read more

Review:
Works efficiently, just takes a bit more time to completely clear the particles in air, which is manageable in this price range. Can be easily adjusted anywhere in the room, compact cylindrical. Noise level is also very less.Read more

Bought the product and within 3 days it malfunctioned. AQI showed 500 when other air purifier (which we got from the 2nd bedroom as a reference check) showed it at 100. Called Amazon and were told to directly contact manufacturer or service center as they do not assist with return or replacement for this product. Moral: Do not buy high value electronics from Amazon. Deal directly with the distributor.Apparently there is a 10-day service center replacement but I am due to go on work travel tomorrow and by the time I return, it will be past the 10-day window. Not sure what will happen after that but at any rate, I would strongly advise against buying this product from Amazon. Perhaps it was bad luck to receive a defective piece but Amazon has added to our hassle rather than be of help.Read more

Review:
Great product. In just 20 minutes AQI dropped from 380 to 65. Good performance. Stylish and compact. Finally we are breathing some clean air.Read more

I've been using the Philips air purifier for a few weeks, and I'm very impressed. It effectively reduces dust and allergens, and the real-time air quality indicator is a great feature. It operates quietly, making it perfect for my bedroom. The sleek design also blends well with my decor. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to improve their indoor air quality!Read more

I have 3 of these in my home. And these are very effective throughout the year to keep the house clean and protect us from infections (lesser colds in the household and even if one person contracts it doesn't spread to others). We are sleeping more peacefully at night and allergic ailments have gone down.However, when Delhi becomes a gas chamber October last week and November first week (beyond 999 at unmeasurable levels), these purifiers struggle. They are able to bring down to within 100, which is good, but, not in the good range of <30.

I have an infant who is struggling these days because of these elevated levels and the unfortunate fact that PM below 1.0 is also high in Delhi this winter. These purifiers operate till PM 2.5. I will have to try some other brands with more powerful purifiers given the rapidly deteriorating condition in our city.Read more

Works efficiently, just takes a bit more time to completely clear the particles in air, which is manageable in this price range. Can be easily adjusted anywhere in the room, compact cylindrical. Noise level is also very less.Read more

Bought the product and within 3 days it malfunctioned. AQI showed 500 when other air purifier (which we got from the 2nd bedroom as a reference check) showed it at 100. Called Amazon and were told to directly contact manufacturer or service center as they do not assist with return or replacement for this product. Moral: Do not buy high value electronics from Amazon. Deal directly with the distributor.Apparently there is a 10-day service center replacement but I am due to go on work travel tomorrow and by the time I return, it will be past the 10-day window. Not sure what will happen after that but at any rate, I would strongly advise against buying this product from Amazon. Perhaps it was bad luck to receive a defective piece but Amazon has added to our hassle rather than be of help.Read more

Review:
Great product. In just 20 minutes AQI dropped from 380 to 65. Good performance. Stylish and compact. Finally we are breathing some clean air.Read more

I've been using the Philips air purifier for a few weeks, and I'm very impressed. It effectively reduces dust and allergens, and the real-time air quality indicator is a great feature. It operates quietly, making it perfect for my bedroom. The sleek design also blends well with my decor. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to improve their indoor air quality!Read more

I have 3 of these in my home.

We are sleeping more peacefully at night and allergic ailments have gone down.However, when Delhi becomes a gas chamber October last week and November first week (beyond 999 at unmeasurable levels), these purifiers struggle. They are able to bring down to within 100, which is good, but, not in the good range of <30. I have an infant who is struggling these days because of these elevated levels and the unfortunate fact that PM below 1.0 is also high in Delhi this winter. These purifiers operate till PM 2.5. I will have to try some other brands with more powerful purifiers given the rapidly deteriorating condition in our city.Read more

Review:
Works efficiently, just takes a bit more time to completely clear the particles in air, which is manageable in this price range. Can be easily adjusted anywhere in the room, compact cylindrical. Noise level is also very less.Read more

Bought the product and within 3 days it malfunctioned. AQI showed 500 when other air purifier (which we got from the 2nd bedroom as a reference check) showed it at 100. Called Amazon and were told to directly contact manufacturer or service center as they do not assist with return or replacement for this product. Moral: Do not buy high value electronics from Amazon. Deal directly with the distributor.Apparently there is a 10-day service center replacement but I am due to go on work travel tomorrow and by the time I return, it will be past the 10-day window. Not sure what will happen after that but at any rate, I would strongly advise against buying this product from Amazon. Perhaps it was bad luck to receive a defective piece but Amazon has added to our hassle rather than be of help.Read more

Review:
Great product. In just 20 minutes AQI dropped from 380 to 65. Good performance. Stylish and compact. Finally we are breathing some clean air.Read more

I've been using the Philips air purifier for a few weeks, and I'm very impressed. It effectively reduces dust and allergens, and the real-time air quality indicator is a great feature. It operates quietly, making it perfect for my bedroom. The sleek design also blends well with my decor. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to improve their indoor air quality!Read more

I have 3 of these in my home. And these are very effective throughout the year to keep the house clean and protect us from infections (lesser colds in the household and even if one person contracts it doesn't spread to others). We are sleeping more peacefully at night and allergic ailments have gone down.However, when Delhi becomes a gas chamber October last week and November first week (beyond 999 at unmeasurable levels), these purifiers struggle. They are able to bring down to within 100, which is good, but, not in the good range of <30. I have an infant who is struggling these days because of these elevated levels and the unfortunate fact that PM below 1.0 is also high in Delhi this winter. These purifiers operate till PM 2.5. I will have to try some other brands with more powerful purifiers given the rapidly deteriorating condition in our city.Read more

Review:
Works efficiently, just takes a bit more time to completely clear the particles in air, which is manageable in this price range. Can be easily adjusted anywhere in the room, compact cylindrical. Noise level is also very less.Read more

Bought the product and within 3 days it malfunctioned. AQI showed 500 when other air purifier (which we got from the 2nd bedroom as a reference check) showed it at 100. Called Amazon and were told to directly contact manufacturer or service center as they do not assist with return or replacement for this product. Moral: Do not buy high value electronics from Amazon. Deal directly with the distributor.Apparently there is a 10-day service center replacement but I am due to go on work travel tomorrow and by the time I return, it will be past the 10-day window. Not sure what will happen after that but at any rate, I would strongly advise against buying this product from Amazon. Perhaps it was bad luck to receive a defective piece but Amazon has added to our hassle rather than be of help.Read more

Great product. In just 20 minutes AQI dropped from 380 to 65. Good performance. Stylish and compact. Finally we are breathing some clean air.Read more

It operates quietly, making it perfect for my bedroom. The sleek design also blends well with my decor. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to improve their indoor air quality!Read more

I have 3 of these in my home. And these are very effective throughout the year to keep the house clean and protect us from infections (lesser colds in the household and even if one person contracts it doesn't spread to others). We are sleeping more peacefully at night and allergic ailments have gone down.However, when Delhi becomes a gas chamber October last week and November first week (beyond 999 at unmeasurable levels), these purifiers struggle. They are able to bring down to within 100, which is good, but, not in the good range of <30. I have an infant who is struggling these days because of these elevated levels and the unfortunate fact that PM below 1.0 is also high in Delhi this winter. These purifiers operate till PM 2.5. I will have to try some other brands with more powerful purifiers given the rapidly deteriorating condition in our city.Read more

Review:
Works efficiently, just takes a bit more time to completely clear the particles in air, which is manageable in this price range. Can be easily adjusted anywhere in the room, compact cylindrical. Noise level is also very less.Read more

Bought the product and within 3 days it malfunctioned. AQI showed 500 when other air purifier (which we got from the 2nd bedroom as a reference check) showed it at 100. Called Amazon and were told to directly contact manufacturer or service center as they do not assist with return or replacement for this product. Moral: Do not buy high value electronics from Amazon. Deal directly with the distributor.Apparently there is a 10-day service center replacement but I am due to go on work travel tomorrow and by the time I return, it will be past the 10-day window. Not sure what will happen after that but at any rate, I would strongly advise against buying this product from Amazon. Perhaps it was bad luck to receive a defective piece but Amazon has added to our hassle rather than be of help.Read more

Review:
Great product. In just 20 minutes AQI dropped from 380 to 65. Good performance. Stylish and compact. Finally we are breathing some clean air.Read more

I've been using the Philips air purifier for a few weeks, and I'm very impressed. It effectively reduces dust and allergens, and the real-time air quality indicator is a great feature. It operates quietly, making it perfect for my bedroom. The sleek design also blends well with my decor. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to improve their indoor air quality!Read more

I have 3 of these in my home. And these are very effective throughout the year to keep the house clean and protect us from infections (lesser colds in the household and even if one person contracts it doesn't spread to others). We are sleeping more peacefully at night and allergic ailments have gone down.However, when Delhi becomes a gas chamber October last week and November first week (beyond 999 at unmeasurable levels), these purifiers struggle. They are able to bring down to within 100, which is good, but, not in the good range of <30. I have an infant who is struggling these days because of these elevated levels and the unfortunate fact that PM below 1.0 is also high in Delhi this winter. These purifiers operate till PM 2.5. I will have to try some other brands with more powerful purifiers given the rapidly deteriorating condition in our city.Read more

Review:
Works efficiently, just takes a bit more time to completely clear the particles in air, which is manageable in this price range. Can be easily adjusted anywhere in the room, compact cylindrical. Noise level is also very less.Read more

Bought the product and within 3 days it malfunctioned. AQI showed 500 when other air purifier (which we got from the 2nd bedroom as a reference check) showed it at 100. Called Amazon and were told to directly contact manufacturer or service center as they do not assist with return or replacement for this product. Moral: Do not buy high value electronics from Amazon. Deal directly with the distributor.Apparently there is a 10-day service center replacement but I am due to go on work travel tomorrow and by the time I return, it will be past the 10-day window. Not sure what will happen after that but at any rate, I would strongly advise against buying this product from Amazon. Perhaps it was bad luck to receive a defective piece but Amazon has added to our hassle rather than be of help.Read more

Great product. In just 20 minutes AQI dropped from 380 to 65. Good performance. Stylish and compact. Finally we are breathing some clean air.Read more

I've been using the Philips air purifier for a few weeks, and I'm very impressed. It effectively reduces dust and allergens, and the real-time air quality indicator is a great feature. It operates quietly, making it perfect for my bedroom. The sleek design also blends well with my decor. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to improve their indoor air quality!Read more

I have 3 of these in my home. And these are very effective throughout the year to keep the house clean and protect us from infections (lesser colds in the household and even if one person contracts it doesn't spread to others). We are sleeping more peacefully at night and allergic ailments have gone down.However, when Delhi becomes a gas chamber October last week and November first week (beyond 999 at unmeasurable levels), these purifiers struggle. They are able to bring down to within 100, which is good, but, not in the good range of <30. I have an infant who is struggling these days because of these elevated levels and the unfortunate fact that PM below 1.0 is also high in Delhi this winter. These purifiers operate till PM 2.5. I will have to try some other brands with more powerful purifiers given the rapidly deteriorating condition in our city.Read more

Review:
Works efficiently, just takes a bit more time to completely clear the particles in air, which is manageable in this price range. Can be easily adjusted anywhere in the room, compact cylindrical. Noise level is also very less.Read more

Bought the product and within 3 days it malfunctioned. AQI showed 500 when other air purifier (which we got from the 2nd bedroom as a reference check) showed it at 100. Called Amazon and were told to directly contact manufacturer or service center as they do not assist with return or replacement for this product. Moral: Do not buy high value electronics from Amazon. Deal directly with the distributor.Apparently there is a 10-day service center replacement but I am due to go on work travel tomorrow and by the time I return, it will be past the 10-day window. Not sure what will happen after that but at any rate, I would strongly advise against buying this product from Amazon.

Not sure what will happen after that but at any rate, I would strongly advise against buying this product from Amazon. Perhaps it was bad luck to receive a defective piece but Amazon has added to our hassle rather than be of help.Read more

Great product. In just 20 minutes AQI dropped from 380 to 65. Good performance. Stylish and compact. Finally we are breathing some clean air.Read more

I've been using the Philips air purifier for a few weeks, and I'm very impressed. It effectively reduces dust and allergens, and the real-time air quality indicator is a great feature. It operates quietly, making it perfect for my bedroom. The sleek design also blends well with my decor. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to improve their indoor air quality!Read more

I have 3 of these in my home. And these are very effective throughout the year to keep the house clean and protect us from infections (lesser colds in the household and even if one person contracts it doesn't spread to others). We are sleeping more peacefully at night and allergic ailments have gone down.However, when Delhi becomes a gas chamber October last week and November first week (beyond 999 at unmeasurable levels), these purifiers struggle. They are able to bring down to within 100, which is good, but, not in the good range of <30. I have an infant who is struggling these days because of these elevated levels and the unfortunate fact that PM below 1.0 is also high in Delhi this winter. These purifiers operate till PM 2.5. I will have to try some other brands with more powerful purifiers given the rapidly deteriorating condition in our city.Read more

Review:
Works efficiently, just takes a bit more time to completely clear the particles in air, which is manageable in this price range. Can be easily adjusted anywhere in the room, compact cylindrical. Noise level is also very less.Read more

Called Amazon and were told to directly contact manufacturer or service center as they do not assist with return or replacement for this product. Moral: Do not buy high value electronics from Amazon. Deal directly with the distributor.Apparently there is a 10-day service center replacement but I am due to go on work travel tomorrow and by the time I return, it will be past the 10-day window. Not sure what will happen after that but at any rate, I would strongly advise against buying this product from Amazon. Perhaps it was bad luck to receive a defective piece but Amazon has added to our hassle rather than be of help.Read more

Great product. In just 20 minutes AQI dropped from 380 to 65. Good performance. Stylish and compact. Finally we are breathing some clean air.Read more

I've been using the Philips air purifier for a few weeks, and I'm very impressed. It effectively reduces dust and allergens, and the real-time air quality indicator is a great feature. It operates quietly, making it perfect for my bedroom. The sleek design also blends well with my decor. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to improve their indoor air quality!Read more

I have 3 of these in my home. And these are very effective throughout the year to keep the house clean and protect us from infections (lesser colds in the household and even if one person contracts it doesn't spread to others). We are sleeping more peacefully at night and allergic ailments have gone down.However, when Delhi becomes a gas chamber October last week and November first week (beyond 999 at unmeasurable levels), these purifiers struggle. They are able to bring down to within 100, which is good, but, not in the good range of <30. I have an infant who is struggling these days because of these elevated levels and the unfortunate fact that PM below 1.0 is also high in Delhi this winter. These purifiers operate till PM 2.5. I will have to try some other brands with more powerful purifiers given the rapidly deteriorating condition in our city.Read more

Review:
Works efficiently, just takes a bit more time to completely clear the particles in air, which is manageable in this price range. Can be easily adjusted anywhere in the room, compact cylindrical. Noise level is also very less.Read more
