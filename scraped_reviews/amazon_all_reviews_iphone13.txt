iPhone 13 ReviewI recently upgraded to the iPhone 13, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice! The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or multitasking.The Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from photos to videos pop. Battery life is exceptional—I can easily get through a full day without needing to charge.The camera system is a game-changer. The dual cameras capture incredible photos, even in low light, and the new cinematic mode adds a professional touch to videos.iOS is smooth and user-friendly, and the overall design feels premium and sleek. If you’re looking for a reliable, powerful smartphone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!Read more

Review:
First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move iOS then Go with 13 or 16. I’m Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I’m habituated to iOS so it’s not a big deal for me. And coming to my Unboxing experience…Yeah It was very good …Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 …anyone thinking 13 and 14 …No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don’t go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

iPhone 13 ReviewI recently upgraded to the iPhone 13, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice! The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or multitasking.The Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from photos to videos pop. Battery life is exceptional—I can easily get through a full day without needing to charge.The camera system is a game-changer. The dual cameras capture incredible photos, even in low light, and the new cinematic mode adds a professional touch to videos.iOS is smooth and user-friendly, and the overall design feels premium and sleek. If you’re looking for a reliable, powerful smartphone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!Read more

Review:
First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move iOS then Go with 13 or 16. I’m Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I’m habituated to iOS so it’s not a big deal for me. And coming to my Unboxing experience…Yeah It was very good …Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 …anyone thinking 13 and 14 …No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don’t go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8.

In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

iPhone 13 ReviewI recently upgraded to the iPhone 13, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice! The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or multitasking.The Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from photos to videos pop. Battery life is exceptional—I can easily get through a full day without needing to charge.The camera system is a game-changer. The dual cameras capture incredible photos, even in low light, and the new cinematic mode adds a professional touch to videos.iOS is smooth and user-friendly, and the overall design feels premium and sleek. If you’re looking for a reliable, powerful smartphone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!Read more

Review:
First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move iOS then Go with 13 or 16. I’m Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I’m habituated to iOS so it’s not a big deal for me. And coming to my Unboxing experience…Yeah It was very good …Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 …anyone thinking 13 and 14 …No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don’t go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4.

Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

Review:
iPhone 13 ReviewI recently upgraded to the iPhone 13, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice! The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or multitasking.The Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from photos to videos pop. Battery life is exceptional—I can easily get through a full day without needing to charge.The camera system is a game-changer. The dual cameras capture incredible photos, even in low light, and the new cinematic mode adds a professional touch to videos.iOS is smooth and user-friendly, and the overall design feels premium and sleek. If you’re looking for a reliable, powerful smartphone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!Read more

Review:
First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move iOS then Go with 13 or 16. I’m Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I’m habituated to iOS so it’s not a big deal for me. And coming to my Unboxing experience…Yeah It was very good …Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 …anyone thinking 13 and 14 …No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don’t go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1.

This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

Review:
The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

iPhone 13 ReviewI recently upgraded to the iPhone 13, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice! The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or multitasking.The Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from photos to videos pop. Battery life is exceptional—I can easily get through a full day without needing to charge.The camera system is a game-changer. The dual cameras capture incredible photos, even in low light, and the new cinematic mode adds a professional touch to videos.iOS is smooth and user-friendly, and the overall design feels premium and sleek. If you’re looking for a reliable, powerful smartphone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!Read more

First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move iOS then Go with 13 or 16. I’m Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I’m habituated to iOS so it’s not a big deal for me. And coming to my Unboxing experience…Yeah It was very good …Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 …anyone thinking 13 and 14 …No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don’t go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth.

I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

iPhone 13 ReviewI recently upgraded to the iPhone 13, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice! The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or multitasking.The Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from photos to videos pop. Battery life is exceptional—I can easily get through a full day without needing to charge.The camera system is a game-changer. The dual cameras capture incredible photos, even in low light, and the new cinematic mode adds a professional touch to videos.iOS is smooth and user-friendly, and the overall design feels premium and sleek. If you’re looking for a reliable, powerful smartphone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!Read more

First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move iOS then Go with 13 or 16. I’m Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I’m habituated to iOS so it’s not a big deal for me. And coming to my Unboxing experience…Yeah It was very good …Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 …anyone thinking 13 and 14 …No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don’t go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

And coming to my Unboxing experience…Yeah It was very good …Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 …anyone thinking 13 and 14 …No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don’t go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

iPhone 13 ReviewI recently upgraded to the iPhone 13, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice! The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or multitasking.The Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from photos to videos pop. Battery life is exceptional—I can easily get through a full day without needing to charge.The camera system is a game-changer. The dual cameras capture incredible photos, even in low light, and the new cinematic mode adds a professional touch to videos.iOS is smooth and user-friendly, and the overall design feels premium and sleek. If you’re looking for a reliable, powerful smartphone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!Read more

Review:
First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move iOS then Go with 13 or 16. I’m Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I’m habituated to iOS so it’s not a big deal for me. And coming to my Unboxing experience…Yeah It was very good …Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 …anyone thinking 13 and 14 …No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don’t go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

iPhone 13 ReviewI recently upgraded to the iPhone 13, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice! The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or multitasking.The Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from photos to videos pop. Battery life is exceptional—I can easily get through a full day without needing to charge.The camera system is a game-changer. The dual cameras capture incredible photos, even in low light, and the new cinematic mode adds a professional touch to videos.iOS is smooth and user-friendly, and the overall design feels premium and sleek. If you’re looking for a reliable, powerful smartphone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!Read more

Review:
First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move iOS then Go with 13 or 16. I’m Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I’m habituated to iOS so it’s not a big deal for me. And coming to my Unboxing experience…Yeah It was very good …Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 …anyone thinking 13 and 14 …No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don’t go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8.

Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

iPhone 13 ReviewI recently upgraded to the iPhone 13, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice! The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or multitasking.The Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from photos to videos pop. Battery life is exceptional—I can easily get through a full day without needing to charge.The camera system is a game-changer. The dual cameras capture incredible photos, even in low light, and the new cinematic mode adds a professional touch to videos.iOS is smooth and user-friendly, and the overall design feels premium and sleek. If you’re looking for a reliable, powerful smartphone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!Read more

Review:
First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move iOS then Go with 13 or 16. I’m Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I’m habituated to iOS so it’s not a big deal for me. And coming to my Unboxing experience…Yeah It was very good …Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 …anyone thinking 13 and 14 …No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don’t go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice.

Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

Review:
iPhone 13 ReviewI recently upgraded to the iPhone 13, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice! The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or multitasking.The Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from photos to videos pop. Battery life is exceptional—I can easily get through a full day without needing to charge.The camera system is a game-changer. The dual cameras capture incredible photos, even in low light, and the new cinematic mode adds a professional touch to videos.iOS is smooth and user-friendly, and the overall design feels premium and sleek. If you’re looking for a reliable, powerful smartphone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!Read more

Review:
First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move iOS then Go with 13 or 16. I’m Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I’m habituated to iOS so it’s not a big deal for me. And coming to my Unboxing experience…Yeah It was very good …Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 …anyone thinking 13 and 14 …No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don’t go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up.

The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

iPhone 13 ReviewI recently upgraded to the iPhone 13, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice! The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or multitasking.The Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from photos to videos pop. Battery life is exceptional—I can easily get through a full day without needing to charge.The camera system is a game-changer. The dual cameras capture incredible photos, even in low light, and the new cinematic mode adds a professional touch to videos.iOS is smooth and user-friendly, and the overall design feels premium and sleek. If you’re looking for a reliable, powerful smartphone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!Read more

First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move iOS then Go with 13 or 16. I’m Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I’m habituated to iOS so it’s not a big deal for me. And coming to my Unboxing experience…Yeah It was very good …Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 …anyone thinking 13 and 14 …No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don’t go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

Review:
The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

iPhone 13 ReviewI recently upgraded to the iPhone 13, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice! The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or multitasking.The Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from photos to videos pop. Battery life is exceptional—I can easily get through a full day without needing to charge.The camera system is a game-changer. The dual cameras capture incredible photos, even in low light, and the new cinematic mode adds a professional touch to videos.iOS is smooth and user-friendly, and the overall design feels premium and sleek. If you’re looking for a reliable, powerful smartphone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!Read more

First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move iOS then Go with 13 or 16. I’m Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I’m habituated to iOS so it’s not a big deal for me. And coming to my Unboxing experience…Yeah It was very good …Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 …anyone thinking 13 and 14 …No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don’t go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

iPhone 13 ReviewI recently upgraded to the iPhone 13, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice! The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or multitasking.The Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from photos to videos pop. Battery life is exceptional—I can easily get through a full day without needing to charge.The camera system is a game-changer. The dual cameras capture incredible photos, even in low light, and the new cinematic mode adds a professional touch to videos.iOS is smooth and user-friendly, and the overall design feels premium and sleek. If you’re looking for a reliable, powerful smartphone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!Read more

First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move iOS then Go with 13 or 16. I’m Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I’m habituated to iOS so it’s not a big deal for me.

First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move iOS then Go with 13 or 16. I’m Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I’m habituated to iOS so it’s not a big deal for me. And coming to my Unboxing experience…Yeah It was very good …Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 …anyone thinking 13 and 14 …No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don’t go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

iPhone 13 ReviewI recently upgraded to the iPhone 13, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice! The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or multitasking.The Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from photos to videos pop. Battery life is exceptional—I can easily get through a full day without needing to charge.The camera system is a game-changer. The dual cameras capture incredible photos, even in low light, and the new cinematic mode adds a professional touch to videos.iOS is smooth and user-friendly, and the overall design feels premium and sleek.

The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or multitasking.The Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from photos to videos pop. Battery life is exceptional—I can easily get through a full day without needing to charge.The camera system is a game-changer. The dual cameras capture incredible photos, even in low light, and the new cinematic mode adds a professional touch to videos.iOS is smooth and user-friendly, and the overall design feels premium and sleek. If you’re looking for a reliable, powerful smartphone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!Read more

Review:
First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move iOS then Go with 13 or 16. I’m Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I’m habituated to iOS so it’s not a big deal for me. And coming to my Unboxing experience…Yeah It was very good …Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 …anyone thinking 13 and 14 …No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don’t go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

iPhone 13 ReviewI recently upgraded to the iPhone 13, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice! The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or multitasking.The Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from photos to videos pop. Battery life is exceptional—I can easily get through a full day without needing to charge.The camera system is a game-changer. The dual cameras capture incredible photos, even in low light, and the new cinematic mode adds a professional touch to videos.iOS is smooth and user-friendly, and the overall design feels premium and sleek. If you’re looking for a reliable, powerful smartphone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!Read more

Review:
First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move iOS then Go with 13 or 16. I’m Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I’m habituated to iOS so it’s not a big deal for me. And coming to my Unboxing experience…Yeah It was very good …Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 …anyone thinking 13 and 14 …No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don’t go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8.

In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

iPhone 13 ReviewI recently upgraded to the iPhone 13, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice! The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or multitasking.The Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from photos to videos pop. Battery life is exceptional—I can easily get through a full day without needing to charge.The camera system is a game-changer. The dual cameras capture incredible photos, even in low light, and the new cinematic mode adds a professional touch to videos.iOS is smooth and user-friendly, and the overall design feels premium and sleek. If you’re looking for a reliable, powerful smartphone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!Read more

Review:
First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move iOS then Go with 13 or 16. I’m Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I’m habituated to iOS so it’s not a big deal for me. And coming to my Unboxing experience…Yeah It was very good …Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 …anyone thinking 13 and 14 …No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don’t go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4.

Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

Review:
iPhone 13 ReviewI recently upgraded to the iPhone 13, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice! The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or multitasking.The Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from photos to videos pop. Battery life is exceptional—I can easily get through a full day without needing to charge.The camera system is a game-changer. The dual cameras capture incredible photos, even in low light, and the new cinematic mode adds a professional touch to videos.iOS is smooth and user-friendly, and the overall design feels premium and sleek. If you’re looking for a reliable, powerful smartphone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!Read more

Review:
First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move iOS then Go with 13 or 16. I’m Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I’m habituated to iOS so it’s not a big deal for me. And coming to my Unboxing experience…Yeah It was very good …Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 …anyone thinking 13 and 14 …No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don’t go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1.

This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

Review:
The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

iPhone 13 ReviewI recently upgraded to the iPhone 13, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice! The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or multitasking.The Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from photos to videos pop. Battery life is exceptional—I can easily get through a full day without needing to charge.The camera system is a game-changer. The dual cameras capture incredible photos, even in low light, and the new cinematic mode adds a professional touch to videos.iOS is smooth and user-friendly, and the overall design feels premium and sleek. If you’re looking for a reliable, powerful smartphone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!Read more

First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move iOS then Go with 13 or 16. I’m Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I’m habituated to iOS so it’s not a big deal for me. And coming to my Unboxing experience…Yeah It was very good …Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 …anyone thinking 13 and 14 …No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don’t go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth.

I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

iPhone 13 ReviewI recently upgraded to the iPhone 13, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice! The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or multitasking.The Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from photos to videos pop. Battery life is exceptional—I can easily get through a full day without needing to charge.The camera system is a game-changer. The dual cameras capture incredible photos, even in low light, and the new cinematic mode adds a professional touch to videos.iOS is smooth and user-friendly, and the overall design feels premium and sleek. If you’re looking for a reliable, powerful smartphone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!Read more

First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move iOS then Go with 13 or 16. I’m Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I’m habituated to iOS so it’s not a big deal for me. And coming to my Unboxing experience…Yeah It was very good …Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 …anyone thinking 13 and 14 …No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don’t go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

And coming to my Unboxing experience…Yeah It was very good …Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 …anyone thinking 13 and 14 …No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don’t go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I’ll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers…Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.Read more

I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!Read more

The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.Read more

iPhone 13 ReviewI recently upgraded to the iPhone 13, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice! The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, whether I’m gaming, streaming, or multitasking.The Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from photos to videos pop. Battery life is exceptional—I can easily get through a full day without needing to charge.The camera system is a game-changer. The dual cameras capture incredible photos, even in low light, and the new cinematic mode adds a professional touch to videos.iOS is smooth and user-friendly, and the overall design feels premium and sleek. If you’re looking for a reliable, powerful smartphone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!Read more
